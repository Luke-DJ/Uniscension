# Uniscension

Uniscension is the result of the first game jam during my second year of University.  
The team consisted of four designers and two programmers, and the game jam lasted four and a half days.  
My contribution mainly consisted of the randomised level spawning & movement, UI/highscores, audio management, and particles (portals, 'death fog', tree blossom).  
More details regarding the structure of the game jam can be found <a href="Teaching Structure.docx" target="_blank">here</a>.
