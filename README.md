# Uniscension

Uniscension is the result of the first game jam during my second year of University.  
I lead my team, which consisted of four designers and two programmers, and the game jam lasted four and a half days.  
My contribution mainly consisted of the randomised level spawning & movement, UI/highscores, audio management, and particles (portals, 'death fog', tree blossom).  
The game can be played <a href="Uniscension.exe" target="_blank">here</a>.  
Our presentation outlining our development process can be found <a href="Uniscension Presentation.pptx" target="_blank">here</a>.
